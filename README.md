# Food Delivery Data Analysis – Innomatics Hackathon

## Overview
This project is part of the Innomatics Research Labs internship hackathon.  
The objective is to work with real-world data from multiple formats, merge them into a single dataset, and derive meaningful insights using Python and Pandas.

After a long time, I really enjoyed working on real data and understanding how actual data integration and analysis works.

---

## Datasets Used
- **orders.csv** – Transactional order data  
- **users.json** – User master data (membership, city, etc.)  
- **restaurants.sql** – Restaurant master data (cuisine, rating, etc.)

---

## Key Tasks Performed
- Loaded data from CSV, JSON, and SQL formats
- Cleaned and standardized column names
- Merged datasets using **left joins**
- Created a final dataset as a single source of truth
- Performed analysis on:
  - Order trends
  - Revenue distribution
  - Gold vs Regular users
  - City-wise and cuisine-wise performance

## Files in This Repository
- `Food_Delivery_Hackathon_Innomatics.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `final_food_delivery_dataset.csv` – Final merged dataset
- `README.md` – Project overview and explanation

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQLite
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for analysis)

---

## Notes
- All answers and insights are derived only from the final merged dataset.
- Left joins were used to ensure no order data was lost.
- Missing values were handled as `NaN`.

## Experience
This hackathon helped me understand real-world data handling, merging datasets, and extracting insights.  
It was a great learning experience and boosted my confidence in working with actual data instead of just theory.
